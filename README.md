# React Mini Projects

## ▶️ How to Run a Project

All projects are managed from a single `App.jsx` file.

To run a specific project:

1. Open `src/App.jsx`
2. Change the value of `ACTIVE_APP` to the required project name

Example:

```js
const ACTIVE_APP = "TODO";
```

Available options:

* `BUTTON`
* `COUNTER`
* `FORM`
* `TODO`
* `LOTTERY`
* `COMMENTS`
* `JOKER`
